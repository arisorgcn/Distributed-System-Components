### 一、Registry and Config Center（service discovery, configuration and service management）

#### 1. Nacos

an easy-to-use dynamic service discovery, configuration and service management platform for building cloud native applications

#### 2. ZooKeeper

ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications. It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs.
